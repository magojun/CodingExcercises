/*
Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighboring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighboring, too).

Given n and firstNumber, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.

Example

For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.

int circleOfNumbers(int n, int firstNumber) {
    int diametro = n/2;
    if (firstNumber >= diametro)
        diametro = diametro*-1;

    return firstNumber+diametro;
}

int circleOfNumbersBestAnswer(int n, int firstNumber) 
{
    return(((n/2)+firstNumber) % n);
