/*In tennis, the winner of a set is based on how many games each player wins. The first player to win 6 games is declared the winner unless their opponent had already won 5 games, in which case the set continues until one of the players has won 7 games.

Given two integers score1 and score2, your task is to determine if it is possible for a tennis set to be finished with a final score of score1 : score2.

Example

For score1 = 3 and score2 = 6, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = true.

Since player 1 hadn't reached 5 wins, the set ends once player 2 has won 6 games.

For score1 = 8 and score2 = 5, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = false.

Since both players won at least 5 games, the set would've ended once one of them won the 7th one.

For score1 = 6 and score2 = 5, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = false.

This set will continue until one of these players wins their 7th game, so this can't be the final score.*/

bool tennisSet(int score1, int score2) {
    bool finalResult = false;
    
    if (score1 == 6 && score2 < 5 || score2 == 6 && score1 < 5)
        finalResult = true;
    if (score1 == 7 && score2 >= 5 && score2 <= 6 ||
        score2 == 7 && score1 >= 5 && score1 <= 6 )
        finalResult = true;
    if (score1 > 7 || score2 > 7)
        finalResult = false;
    
    return finalResult;
}


bool tennisSetBestAnswer(int score1, int score2) 
{
    if ( Math.Min(score1, score2) >= 7 )
    {
        return false;
    }
    
    if ( Math.Min(score1, score2) >= 5 )
    {
        return Math.Max(score1, score2) == 7;
    }
    
    return Math.Max(score1, score2) == 6;
}
